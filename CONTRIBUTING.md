## Testing

To test chainerrl modules, install and run `pytest`. Pass `-m "not gpu"` to skip tests that require gpu.

To test examples, run `test_examples.sh [gpu device id]`. `-1` would run examples with only cpu.

## Coding style

We use PEP8. To check your code, use `flake8` command installed by `hacking` package.
```
$ pip install hacking
$ flake8 path/to/your/code.py
```

To use Python 3 features as much as possible while keeping Python 2 support, add the following lines to the head of each file.
```
from __future__ import print_function
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import absolute_import
from builtins import *  # NOQA
from future import standard_library
standard_library.install_aliases()
```
