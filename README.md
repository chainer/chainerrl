## Installation

ChainerRL is tested with Python 2.7+ and 3.5.1+. For other requirements, see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

ChainerRL can be installed via PyPI:
```
pip install chainerrl
```

It can also be installed from the source code:
```
python setup.py install
```

Refer to [Installation](http://chainerrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for more information on installation. 

## Getting started

You can try [ChainerRL Quickstart Guide](examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb) first, or check the [examples](examples) ready for Atari 2600 and Open AI Gym.

For more information, you can refer to [ChainerRL's documentation](http://chainerrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Discrete Action | Continous Action | Recurrent Model | CPU Async Training |
|:----------|:---------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:------------------:|
| DQN (including DoubleDQN etc.) | ✓ | ✓ (NAF) | ✓ | x |
| Categorical DQN | ✓ | x | ✓ | x |
| DDPG | x | ✓ | ✓ | x |
| A3C  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| ACER | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| NSQ (N-step Q-learning) | ✓ | ✓ (NAF) | ✓ | ✓ |
| PCL (Path Consistency Learning) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

| TRPO | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |

Following algorithms have been implemented in ChainerRL:
- A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)
- ACER (Actor-Critic with Experience Replay)
- Asynchronous N-step Q-learning
- Categorical DQN
- DQN (including Double DQN, Persistent Advantage Learning (PAL), Double PAL, Dynamic Policy Programming (DPP))
- DDPG (Deep Deterministic Poilcy Gradients) (including SVG(0))
- PGT (Policy Gradient Theorem)
- PCL (Path Consistency Learning)
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization)

Q-function based algorithms such as DQN can utilize a Normalized Advantage Function (NAF) to tackle continuous-action problems as well as DQN-like discrete output networks.

## Environments

Environments that support the subset of OpenAI Gym's interface (`reset` and `step` methods) can be used.
